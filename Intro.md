1. What is System Design?

System Design is the blueprint of how software works at scale. It's how you design a big app like YouTube, Instagram, or even a tuition booking app.

It's not about writing code — it's about:

What parts do you need?

How do they talk to each other?

How does it stay fast, safe, and available to millions?

2. Real-Life Analogy: Building a Chai Stall App

Let’s say we want to build: "Pooja’s Chai Ordering App"

So what do we need?

1. Frontend (Client) – App/Website where you place orders


2. Backend (Server) – Brain that takes your order and responds


3. Database – Where all chai orders are stored


4. APIs – The menu and waiters (ways frontend and backend talk)


5. Load Balancer – Bouncer who redirects requests so no one shop is overloaded


6. Cache – Fast-access shelf for most popular chai


7. Queue – If too many orders, line them up (like Swiggy does)


8. Database Replica – Backup chai notebooks to avoid delays


9. CDN – Store chai images closer to users

4. High-Level Flow (Instagram Example)

[You] → [App] → [API] → [Backend Server] → [Database]

                               [Cache]
                                 ↓
                           [Load Balancer]
                                 ↓
                            [Other servers]
