Microservices vs Monolith – System Design Showdown

> The big question: One kingdom or many allied villages?




---

1. What is a Monolith?

A Monolithic Architecture is a single, unified codebase that handles everything — from login, payments, search, to notifications — all in one app.

Example:

[ChaiSewa App] = One big service with all features bundled

Analogy: Like a thali — all dishes on one plate. Easy to serve, hard to change one item.


---

2. What is Microservices Architecture?

Microservices break the application into independent smaller services, each handling a specific task.

Example:

Login Service | Order Service | Payment Service | Notification Service

Each can be built, deployed, and scaled independently.

Analogy: Like a buffet — every item is cooked, served, and replaced separately.

4. When to Use Monolith?

Startups or small teams

Fast MVP development

Simple business logic


Example: Early-stage apps like a personal blog, small e-commerce site


---

5. When to Use Microservices?

Large teams working independently

Complex business with scaling needs

Frequent deployments by different teams


Example: Netflix, Amazon, Zomato


---

6. Challenges of Microservices

More DevOps & infrastructure work

Need for API gateways, service discovery, and monitoring

Network issues (latency, retries, timeouts)

Versioning + managing backward compatibility

7. Real-Life Example: Instagram

Started as a monolith

Grew in scale → moved search, messaging, stories into microservices



---

✅ Summary – What to Remember

Monolith = Simple, great to start with

Microservices = Complex, powerful for scaling

Monoliths grow into microservices as teams & complexity grow

Use based on team size, tech maturity, and growth goals
