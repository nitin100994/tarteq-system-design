Rate Limiting & API Protection – Deep Dive

> Stop spammers. Control overload. Protect your app like a fortress.

1. What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is a system rule to limit how many times a user or client can call an API in a given time period.

Example:

Max 100 requests per user per minute

Only 5 OTPs per phone number per hour


Analogy: Like a guard at a club entrance: "You've had enough for now, wait a bit."

2. Why Use Rate Limiting?

Prevent abuse (e.g., spamming login or OTP)

Protect backend servers from overload

Block malicious bots

Ensure fair usage for all users

3. Where It's Applied


---

4. Popular Algorithms for Rate Limiting

1. Token Bucket (Most Common)

Each user gets tokens

Every request takes 1 token

Tokens refill over time


2. Leaky Bucket

Requests flow into a bucket

Bucket leaks at constant rate

If too many at once, overflow = reject


3. Fixed Window

Limit X requests per minute

Resets at each minute boundary


4. Sliding Window

Smooth counter within last N seconds (rolling window)

5. Tools and Libraries

6. Designing Rate Limiting with Redis

INCR user:123
EXPIRE user:123 60  # expire after 60s

If count > 100 → block

Redis handles this with lightning speed

7. Rate Limiting Strategy

8. Diagram: Token Bucket Flow

[Request] → [Token Bucket Check] → [Allow / Block]
             (If token available)
                 ↓
           [Process Request]

Tokens refill every second/minute.

✅ Summary – What to Remember

Rate limiting = API bouncer

Prevents spam, overload, abuse

Common strategies: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Sliding Window

Implement using Redis, API Gateways, NGINX

Always set fair usage limits (auth vs guest, paid vs free)
